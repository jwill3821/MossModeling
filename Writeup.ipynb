    "The moss class is similar in ways to the animal class from homework three, inspiration was taken from the age functions and the check if dead function. We set an age limit of 5 iterations for each moss, the check if dead function takes this age limit and compares it to each moss on the board and returns a true or false value. **WORKING ON CODE TO REMOVE THE MOSS IF DEAD** From here we have a replicate function which randomises the adjacent cells on the board, after picking a random cell there is a code which checks the cell type whether a wet or dry land cell type as this affects the growth rate of the moss. Once the code has checked through all of the variables a moss replicate is spawned in a random adjacent cell\n",
